# Asian Option Pricing with Control Variate (Beginner-Level)

This is my solution for the assignment on pricing an Asian option using the control variate technique under the Black-Scholes model.

## What it does

- Simulates asset price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
- Calculates the payoff of an Asian call option
- Applies a control variate using a European option with known analytical price to reduce variance

## Technologies used

- Java
- No external libraries (standard Java only)
- Developed in Eclipse IDE

## Notes

I'm still a beginner in programming and this is my first time implementing this type of financial simulation. I focused on writing clean, working code that passes the basic requirements of the assignment. Feedback is always welcome!
